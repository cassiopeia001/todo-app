### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid 
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Dndkit] (https://dndkit.com/) -Drag and drop toolkit for React

### What I learned

- I learned how to use useMemo() from React for the first time which is a good way to optimize the app.
- I added accessibility to my project and kept it in mind throughout the development process.
- I learned how to use dnd kit for the first time and it is an effective and easy way to implement drag and drop while also making sure to keep the project accessible.

### Continued development

I would like to continue adding accessibility to my projects and improve in that area, and also learn more about how to add drag and drop functionality. In the next projects i would also like to use more React hooks as they can facilitate and optimize the app, and finally i wish to start adding backend to my projects.

### Useful resources
